              I am a software engineer and I bring 3 years of experience in the
              field of Frontend development with React and TypeScript. Creating
              things always played a big role in my life. As a child I used to
              play with LEGO bricks, then started crafting furniture as a
              teenager and learned to design buildings in university, where I
              attained my masters-degree in architecture. Coding started as a
              hobby when I began to think about improving communication and
              processes on construction sites and it soon became a serious
              career path. Driven by the idea to make a bigger impact on society
              and the planet, I want to create applications and user interfaces,
              that help people make everyday life easier. I am currently looking
              for a job in a progressive and forward-thinking company in an
              open-minded and supportive team. I am a team player and like to
              contribute my work to a team of enthusiastic and driven
              colleagues, just as myself. I'm sure I can draw your interest in
              my work below, check it out and don't hesitate to get in touch. I
              am thrilled to hearing from you.

              I can work self-sufficiently and in a remote setting, I am highly
              skilled in organizing my work and contribute to team efforts. In
              the past I overtook responsibilities for junior colleagues and
              releases.
